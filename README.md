# MapleStory

The MapleStory project is a demo created to demonstrate my skills as a software development engineer.
<br/>
It's been written in a team environment with two other developers who contributed to the codebase.

The project is a server emulation to the popular MMORPG game MapleStory.

<br/>

The technology used so far:
* ASP.NET Core
* NET 7.0
* EntityFrameworkCore
* MariaDB
